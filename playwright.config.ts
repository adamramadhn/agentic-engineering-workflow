/**
 * E2E harness config (epic 3 story 1).
 *
 * The scratch database name is derived ONCE here, at config-evaluation scope —
 * the single source of truth for the whole run. Every other consumer reads the
 * derivation through env, never by deriving again in another process:
 *
 *   - the webServer boot script (scripts/e2e-server.mjs) receives it via
 *     webServer.env and creates the database BEFORE `next start` accepts
 *     requests (playwright starts the webServer before globalSetup, and the
 *     app's query() → ensureSchema() seeds roles on the first request);
 *   - globalTeardown (e2e/global-teardown.ts) reads it from process.env, which
 *     this module sets below — config and globalTeardown run in the same
 *     playwright runner process.
 *
 * DATABASE_URL is rewritten to the scratch database by swapping only the
 * database segment of the base string, so the dev database is never a target.
