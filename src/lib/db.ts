/**
 * Idempotent schema bootstrap (schema v3). Runs once per server process before
 * the first query so the app works against a fresh database without a separate
 * migration step.
 *
 * ONE TRANSACTION (D-1). Every block below — v2 through v9 — runs as a single
 * transaction on ONE checked-out client, behind a single transaction-scoped
 * advisory lock taken before the first DDL statement. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
 * EXISTS` is not atomic against itself: two processes booting together both
 * find the catalog entry absent and both insert into `pg_type`, and the loser
 * dies with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_type_typname_nsp_index"`.
 * A lock per block cannot fix that, because the blocks that race run before any
 * of those locks is taken. One global lock first, then everything inside it.
 *
 * A second consequence of the same design: bootstrap holds one pool connection
 * for its whole run. That is acceptable because it happens once per process and
 * is bounded by `lock_timeout` — not once per request.
 *
 * v2 replaces the legacy opaque-session design:
 *   users          id is a native UUID (gen_random_uuid()) instead of TEXT `usr_*`
 *   refresh_tokens JWT refresh material, stored as sha256(jti), rotatable/revocable
 *   sessions       dropped — sessions are now stateless JWT access tokens
 *
 * v3 adds RBAC:
 *   roles          role key → JSONB permission grants (the only permission data in the DB)
 *   role_audit     audit trail for every roles/permissions mutation
 *   users.role     becomes a real FK to roles(key) — in-place upgrade, zero data
 *                  migration (the seed reuses the exact values users.role already holds)
 *
 * v4 adds the Wiki + storage config:
 *   wiki_pages / wiki_labels / wiki_page_labels / wiki_comments / wiki_attachments
 *   wiki_audit    audit trail for every wiki/storage mutation (mirrors role_audit)
 *   app_settings  key → JSONB value store; holds the S3 storage config (the
 *                 requester's explicit "not .env" decision — see the plan)
 *
 * v6 adds OAuth 2.0 PKCE for the BMad Monitor MCP CLI:
 *   oauth_codes           single-use authorization codes (PKCE S256, 60s TTL)
 *   oauth_refresh_tokens  rotatable MCP refresh material, sha256(jti) — separate
 *                         from web refresh_tokens (different revoke semantics)
 *
 * v7 scopes the BMad board to a project (CAP-5):
 *   bmad_tasks / bmad_agent_nodes / bmad_backlogs move from a global
 *   `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY` to `PRIMARY KEY (project_id, id)`, so `TASK-101`
 *   means a different row per project instead of overwriting another project's
 *   task. The child FKs (task_id, parent_id) become composite and must be
 *   CASCADE — the previous `task_id ... ON DELETE SET NULL` is impossible on a
 *   composite key, since SET NULL would null the NOT NULL project_id that is
 *   part of the primary key. bmad_projects gains the two partial unique indexes
 *   that make workspace → project resolution race-safe (identity-mapping.md).
 *
 *   Unlike the blocks above this one runs DDL, so every step is guarded by
 *   pg_constraint state — constraint names are read from the catalog, never
 *   assumed, and re-running it is a no-op. It runs on the bootstrap
 *   transaction's client (see migrateProjectScopedKeys).
 *
 * v8 completes the backlog flow the MCP CLI already models:
 *   bmad_backlogs gains promoted_to_task_id / promoted_by / promoted_at plus a
 *   composite FK to bmad_tasks (project_id, id), so "promoted ⇒ the task
 *   exists" is a database invariant and the server-side promote stays
 *   idempotent. Like v7 this is catalog-guarded DDL on the bootstrap client.
 *
 * v9 folds workspace identity (D-4):
 *   bmad_projects.workspace_path is lowercased in place and
 *   uq_bmad_projects_workspace rebuilt over the folded expression, so
 *   `/Users/X/proj` and `/users/x/proj` are one key. Two rows that collapse
 *   into one key abort the boot with a message naming both projects — merging
 *   is never automatic. Same bootstrap-client shape as v7/v8.

      //   3. SET LOCAL lock_timeout — so waiting for another instance's
